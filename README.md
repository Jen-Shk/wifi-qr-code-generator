# Wi-Fi QR Code Generator & Scanner

This is a small project I made to generate and scan Wi-Fi QR codes.  
The idea is to make it easier to share Wi-Fi without typing the password.

## Features
- Generate QR codes for Wi-Fi (SSID, password, security type, hidden network)
- Download the QR as an image or copy the text
- Scan Wi-Fi QR codes using the camera or by uploading an image
- Works on both mobile and desktop browsers

## How to use
1. Go to the **Generator** tab, enter Wi-Fi details, then click generate. You can download or copy the code.
2. Go to the **Scanner** tab, allow camera access, and point it at a QR code. It will show the Wi-Fi name and password.
3. Use the **Start Scan** button to activate your camera for scanning.
4. Use the **Stop Scan** button to turn off the camera when done.

## Notes
- The scanner asks for camera permission, but it is safe. The camera is only used inside your browser and nothing is stored.
- **Start/Stop** button is added to the **Scanner** tab. Now you can manually start and stop the camera.
- Works best on Chrome, Edge, or Safari mobile.
- Itâ€™s still basic for now, but it works. I plan to improve it later.
